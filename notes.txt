TODO's:
- Make containers have a title that says what it is. Ex. Youtube
- Give keyboard thin boxes around the container. This is to get that in front of all the others without clicking a key.
- Make light color selection for HA Integration
- Make GET functions for HA integrations, to update sliders with correct values.

Integrations:
- (DONE) YouTube
- (DONE) Home Automation (HA)
- (DONE) Weather
- Face Detection
- Spotify
- Soundcloud
- RTSP Streams




Face Detection Notes:
Get a python script to check camera if the face is recognised. Something like this script maybe https://github.com/EbenKouao/MMM-Face-Recognition-SMAI/blob/master/MMM-Face-Recognition-SMAI.py
When a face is detected call the Smart Mirror web-server with a name of which user was detected, and when the server recieves this call, create image with src of users image and how this somewhere on the screen.

OR make the face-detection controller.js look in the .json or .txt file located in the folder, and detect when it has been changed. When it has been changed, update the face-detection container.html to display new image.
