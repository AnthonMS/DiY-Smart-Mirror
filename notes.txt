TODO's:
- Make containers have a title that says what it is. Ex. Youtube
- Give keyboard thin boxes around the container. This is to get that in front of all the others without clicking a key.
- Make light color selection for HA Integration
- Make GET functions for HA integrations, to update sliders with correct values.
- Show QR Code for WiFi Connection on screen if face detected is a guest.

Integrations:
- (DONE) YouTube
- (DONE) Home Automation (HA)
- (DONE) Weather
- Random (Custom) compliments
- Face Detection
- Spotify
- Soundcloud
- RTSP Streams


Weather API Notes:
Need to translate the description to danish. Maybe use Google Translate API. If it works like the youtube search API.

Random (Custom) compliments Notes:
This should be a json file that is hosted on the server like with the face detection text file.
This JSON file should include a bunch of different compliments, when the plugin is loaded, it should load this json into a local variable.
Every 5th minutte, it should display a new, random compliment.
The compliments I will be adding to my json, will be in danish, since I want them in danish.


Face Detection Notes:
Get a python script to check camera if the face is recognised. Something like this script maybe https://github.com/EbenKouao/MMM-Face-Recognition-SMAI/blob/master/MMM-Face-Recognition-SMAI.py
When a face is detected call the Smart Mirror web-server with a name of which user was detected, and when the server recieves this call, create image with src of users image and how this somewhere on the screen.

OR make the face-detection controller.js look in the .json or .txt file located in the folder, and detect when it has been changed. When it has been changed, update the face-detection container.html to display new image.

Cant use depp learning, since this will be running on a Pi, and that is too slow to run real time video face detection.
So I might just use the script mentioned above.
Use deep learning to recognise face, this is much more reliable, but a bit longer process. But a good tutorial is: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/06/18/face-recognition-with-opencv-python-and-deep-learning/
