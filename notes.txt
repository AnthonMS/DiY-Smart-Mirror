TODO's:
- Make containers have a title that says what it is. Ex. Youtube
- Give keyboard thin boxes around the container. This is to get that in front of all the others without clicking a key.
- Maybe the keyboard button should be 100% width at the bottom of the screen instead of in the button menu. I have not decided yet.
- Make light color selection for HA Integration
- Make GET functions for HA integrations, to update sliders with correct values.
- Show QR Code for WiFi Connection on screen if face detected is a guest.
- I don't know if the compliment text should have a button to hide/show the text. It has one for now, but might remove it completely, or maybe add a button at the bottom of the screen.

- RTSP Streams


Weather API Notes:
Need to translate the description to danish. Google translate API costs money, so thats a no-go.
Check out yandex translation API. This requires phone verification, and I don't have my phone on me.


Face Detection Notes:
Get a python script to check camera if the face is recognised. Something like this script maybe https://github.com/EbenKouao/MMM-Face-Recognition-SMAI/blob/master/MMM-Face-Recognition-SMAI.py
When a face is detected call the Smart Mirror web-server with a name of which user was detected, and when the server recieves this call, create image with src of users image and how this somewhere on the screen.

OR make the face-detection controller.js look in the .json or .txt file located in the folder, and detect when it has been changed. When it has been changed, update the face-detection container.html to display new image.

Cant use deep learning, since this will be running on a Pi, and that is too slow to run real time video face detection.
So I might just use the script mentioned above.
